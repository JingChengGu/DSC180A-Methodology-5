## Quarter 2 Project Proposal

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The overarching topic that the Clean Transportation Team at SDG&E is trying to tackle this entire quarter has been finding the optimal locations for EV charging station placement in San Diego. With the growing adaptation of EVs, the demand for public charging stations across SDG&E territories also grows in correlation. It is our task in quarter 1 to find insights into the relationship between existing EV charging stations and existing EV owners and their charging habits. The general topic of EV station placement is definitely the most interesting and the most challenging as well.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A project idea for Q2 would be building an EV Charger Accessibility and Equity Analysis Model. For this project, we focus on creating a model to identify underserved communities with limited access to EV chargers, supporting SDGE’s equity goals by highlighting “charging deserts". The focus will be on lower-income areas with higher EV adoption, where residents might rely more on public chargers due to limited home charging options. The model will also evaluate locations with strategic public charging needs, such as highway exits, public facilities like airports or commercial buildings, and parking lots. The point of this project is to help communities with high EV charging needs and high EV ownership density with low public EV charging accessibility.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
The current quarter 1 project focuses on analysis and EDA. For quarter 2, my main goal is now solution-based. I will shift gears to finding the best solution to the topic I decide to tackle. I would approach quarter 2 with a model-building direction rather than a finding problem direction since that should have already been completed. This shift will allow me to apply data science techniques beyond exploration, developing a solution that aligns with SDGE’s clean transportation goals and contributes to the advancement of EV infrastructure in San Diego.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Any new techniques in model selection and model building would be my main focus between now and the start of my quarter 2 project. I have a decent understanding of the problems at hand in SDG&E, and I now want to use what I know or what I will know to help minimize this issue as much as possible with the limited time I have. For geospatial analysis, GeoPandas and Shapely facilitate spatial operations, while Folium and Pydeck are excellent for building interactive maps that visualize accessibility scores and underserved areas. I plan to host the model on an environment like Jupyter Notebook for easy-to-use access.
